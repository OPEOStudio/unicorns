# unicorns
A comprehensive list of all known unicorns, and their corresponding OSS compatibility

The list is heavily inspired from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unicorn_startup_companies (thanks wiki !!).

Several french unicorns were not part of the list - proposed a commit for Wikipedia, along with corresponding things added.

Columns, apart from the expected country/sector/valuation/stage/short description, are typically Opeo Startup Studio related and rated from 1 (bad) to 10 (good) by our experience :

- First stage bootstrability = no need for extensive cash to prove/disprove the model, making corresponding business a viable candidate for a lean startup stype approach ;
- Organization orientation caters to the need, internally at the organization, for operations-type skillset (being one of the main skillset of OPEO) ;
- Tech-ability ponders whether deep technology can help tremendously the business, or if the fundamentals are elsewhere ;
- Competitive intensity is the competitiveness of the field for likely frontal offer candidates ;
- Localization advantage represents whether hyper-localization helps the business or not ;
- Physical component represents if there is a physical component.

For now, roughly 150 (or a third) of all startups have been rated. Feel free to contribute or give feedback !

Feel free to commit for more !
